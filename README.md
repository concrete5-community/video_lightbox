# Video Lightbox II for ConcreteCMS

Video Lightbox II is a simple, easy-to-use package that allows you to add a text link or image to your website pages.

Clicking the link or image opens a clean, responsive, lightbox-style popup that plays a video.

Flexible Video Sources - Choose to play videos from:

- The ConcreteCMS File Manager (MP4 or supported formats)
- Vimeo
- YouTube

This plugin is ideal for showcasing video tutorials, promotional content, or any engaging mediaâ€”without cluttering your page layout.

No coding required: just drop it into the page and configure with a few clicks!

## Notes

This is a ConcreteCMS package inspired with the good old [Video Lightbox](https://web.archive.org/web/20180110023334/https://www.concrete5.org/marketplace/addons/video-lightbox) by [Steev Beech](https://community.concretecms.com/members/profile/9622).

Video Lightbox II maintains compatibility with the original version in the following ways:

- Uses the same database name and field definitions
- Retains the same package and block type handles
- Supports MP4 video playback from the Concrete File Manager
- Supports video embedding from YouTube and Vimeo
