# Video Lightbox II for ConcreteCMS

Video Lightbox II is a simple, easy-to-use package that allows you to add a text link or image to your website pages.

Clicking the link or image opens a clean, responsive, lightbox-style popup that plays a video.

This plugin is ideal for showcasing video tutorials, promotional content, or any engaging mediaâ€”without cluttering your page layout.

No coding required: just drop it into the page and configure with a few clicks!

## Features

- Flexible Video Sources - Choose to play videos from:
  - The ConcreteCMS File Manager (MP4 or supported formats)
  - Vimeo
  - YouTube
- Preview Options
  - View the image/text link in edit mode - no "Disabled in edit mode" text
  - Preview the video popup while adding/editing the block (so you can check the URL and sizing without saving first)

## Notes

This is a ConcreteCMS package inspired with the good old [Video Lightbox](https://web.archive.org/web/20180110023334/https://www.concrete5.org/marketplace/addons/video-lightbox) by [Steev Beech](https://community.concretecms.com/members/profile/9622).

Video Lightbox II is a drop-in replacement for the original Video Lightbox, offering the following compatibilities:

- Compatible database names and field definitions
- Compatible package and block type handles
- MP4 video playback support via the Concrete File Manager
- Video embedding support for YouTube and Vimeo

So, in most cases you can simply replace the `video_lightbox` directory in your `packages` folder with the code from this new package.
