# Video Lightbox II for ConcreteCMS

This is a ConcreteCMS package inspired with the good old [Video Lightbox](https://web.archive.org/web/20180110023334/https://www.concrete5.org/marketplace/addons/video-lightbox) by [Steev Beech](https://community.concretecms.com/members/profile/9622).

Video Lightbox II is compatible with the original Video Lightbox for these aspects:

- definition of database fields
- handle of the package and of the block type
- support for playing MP4 videos from the Concrete File Manager
- support for playing YouTube and Vimeo videos
